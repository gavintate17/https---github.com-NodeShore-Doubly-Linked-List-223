The numbers are the amount of shade-bearing trees next to each street section from east to west.
The first number in each street is between Ruby and Lidgerwood, which is twice the length of the other street segments.
All other street segments are roughly the same size.
Where there would be a street in Augusta (the -1) is instead a field for a school with some shade-bearing trees on the sides.
